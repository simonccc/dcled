<h1>Dream Cheeky USB Message Board</h1>

<p>I was looking for a cool christmas present for my brother, and came across this:

<p>The USB Message Board from 
<a href="http://www.dreamcheeky.com/index.php?pagename=product&pid=52">Dream Cheeky</a>.  
</center>

<p>Ok, so it has a silly name,  but it is a cute little scrolling led display
none the less.  Unfortunately, it is for Windows only.  When I found out that
the 
<a href="USB LED Message Board - Developer Manual v1.0.pdf">Hardware Developer Manual</a> 
was available though, I thought it
would be fun to try and write a Linux driver for it.  Version 1.0 took a long saturday afternoon to write- about twelve hours.

<p>I set up dcled so that it works like cat.  If you run dcled with a list of
files, it will cat each of those files to the message board.  If you dont name
any files at all, dcled reads from stdin, so that you can use it as a pipe.
There is also the --message="" option in case you want to send a single line to
it.

<p>After using the program for a little while to monitor <a
href="http://www.last-outpost.com">The Last Outpost</a> game server, I found that I
was always missing the first few words of the message-- by the time I noticed
something scrolling and looked up to see what it said, the beginning of the
text was off screen.  I added 'preamble' mode to fix this problem.  If you use
preamble mode (and there are several diffrent ones now), then just before
scrolling the message, a fancy eye-catching graphic is displayed.  For some
preamble modes, a graphic is displayed at the end of the message too.  

<p>When dumping a file with preamble mode enabled, the start graphic gets
displayed anytime that the screen hasn't had an update in at least ten seconds.
This is useful when you monitor a logfile with tail -f and pipe into dcled.  It
puts the eye-catcher graphic in front of every new burst of log entries.  I
usually run with the echo option turned on too, so that the log messages go to
the screen as well as to the message board.

<p>Example: <code>tail -f /var/log/messages | dcled -p 2 -e </code>

<p>The full set of options looks something like this:
<pre>

<p>You can <a href="dcled-2.2.tgz">download version 2.2 of dcled</a> and use it
to send text to the message board under Linux, Mac OS X 10.5.6, and perhaps
other operating systems for which you can compile libusb.  Dcled is a userland
program, and shouldn't require any kernel recompiling at all, but you will
require the libusb-1.0-dev pacakge to be installed.

<p>Let me know if you find it useful!

<p>Sat Feb  8 21:18:23 PST 2014 - dcled 2.2 released!  Added 'tachometer mode', to make the display work as a scriptable gauge.  If you run Linux, try the included cpuload program to make dcled monitor your system processor load.

<p>Sat Sep  8 08:10:19 PDT 2012 - dcled 2.1 released! No new functionality in
this release, but the usb driver section has been re-written to use the libusb
directly instead of going through libhid.  This removes the libhid requirement,
so building on debian based systems ought to be easier.  Big thanks to Lewis
Clayton for the libusb primer!

Sat Sep  8 08:21:58 PDT 2012 - Lewis Clayton has written a userland driver in
the Ruby language for the Dream Cheeky USB LED Message Board.  You can check
out his work on <a
href="https://github.com/Lewis-Clayton/dcled_ruby">GitHub</a>. Way to go,
Lewis!

<p>Sat Apr  9 17:52:12 PDT 2011 - A dcled user asked me if I could port dcled
over to the "Inland Six Message Programmable LED Badge".  Nope, not possible,
it turns out.  The two devices are very different in how they work.  The Inland
doesnt provide direct access to the LEDs like the DC does.  The Inland one is
interesting though in that it can scroll a message on its own after it has been
programmed-- there is no need to use the host cpu to drive the leds.  That
might make it useful as a staus display on a small embedded system like the
DLink DIR-825 running <a href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWRT.</a>

<p>Luckily, <a href="http://hentenaar.com">Tim Hentenaar</a> had already
reverse engineered the programming protocol for the Inland badge, and had
written a GUI to program it.  I took his library and implemented a cli
programming tool for the badge, and he's incorporated it into his <a
href="http://hentenaar.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/41-Control-Software-for-the-Inland-USB-LED-Badge.html">Control
Software for the Inland USB LED Badge</a>.  It is worth looking at if you can't
find the DC message board anymore.
